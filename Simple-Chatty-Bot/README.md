# Simple-Chatty-Bot
In this project, I'm creating step by step a simple bot.

For the first stage, I'm writing a bot who displays a greeting, its name and the date of its creation.
Hello! My name is {botName}.
I was created in {birthYear}.


At this stage, the user will introduce himself to the bot. He will greet you by your name and then will try to guess your age using arithmetic operations.
Hello! My name is {botname}.
I was created in {birthyear}.
Please, remind me your name.
What a great name you have, {yourName}!
Let me guess your age.
Enter remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
Your age is {yourAge}; that's a good time to start programming!


At this stage, I am programming the bot to count from 0 to any positive number entered.
Hello! My name is {botname}.
I was created in {birthyear}.
Please, remind me your name.
What a great name you have, {yourname}!
Let me guess your age.
Say me remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
Your age is {yourage}; that's a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.


At this stage, I'm improving my simple bot so that it can give you a test and check your answers. The test should be about programming. My bot will continue to ask the test until the answer is correct.
an option starts with a digit followed by the dot (1., 2., 3., 4.)
If a user enters an incorrect answer, the bot may print a message:
Please, try again.

Hello! My name is {botname}.
I was created in {birthyear}.
Please, remind me your name.
What a great name you have, {yourname}!
Let me guess your age.
Say me remainders of dividing your age by 3, 5 and 7.
Your age is {yourage}: that's a good time to start programming!
Now I will prove to you that I can count to any number you want.
Let's test your programming knowledge.
Why do we use methods?
1. To repeat a statement multiple times.
2. To decompose a program into several small subroutines.
3. To determine the execution time of a program.
4. To interrupt the execution of a program.

Congratulations, correct answer!
Congratulations, have a nice day!
